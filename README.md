# RALMO2BUFR

This python script uses eccodes to encode RALMO data, i.e. temperature and humidity, into BUFR.

RALMO data are retrieved from DWH using jretrievedwh (see https://meteoswiss.atlassian.net/wiki/x/voK7)

The Jupyter notebook provides important instruction to set up the environment and to activate the eccmodule, assuming you work on Balfrin on CSCS.

The BUFR encoder was generated with eccodes and a sample BUFR file of a similar type.
